            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>The extraordinary outcomes of deep learning methods should be viewed in the light of certain
                prerequisites, the first and foremost being the necessity of large amounts of clean labeled data. For
                medical imaging, dataset labeling costs are pretty steep given the domain expertise required for
                labeling medical data. This, in combination with the high computing cost that is associated with deep
                learning algorithms, prevents the democratization of utilizing machine learning algorithms in low- and
                middle-income countries. This is especially true for India which is data-rich due to the rapid
                digitalization of medical imaging procedures but labeled-data poor. In this tutorial, we will
                demonstrate several robust ML optimization techniques that can be used in low-data, low-resource
                settings. Our tutorial contains several semi-supervised and weakly supervised methods that utilize
                shallow machine-learning models and heuristic-driven models as labeling functions to label only a subset
                of unlabeled data points, instead of the whole set. We will demonstrate how close are these methods to
                the state-of-the-art deep learning methods, demonstrating in their utility for labeling medical
                datasets.</p>
